# Weather App

This weather app shows my understanding of using other APIs and showcase my abilty of create an UI using React. All of my data is from the [OpenWeatherMap API](https://openweathermap.org/).

## Installation

### 1. Clone the repository:

```
git clone https://github.com/N20Code/Weather-App.git
```

### 2. Install dependencies:

```
yarn
```

or

```
npm install
```

### 3. Get API key:

Go to https://openweathermap.org/api and sign up for an account. Then subscribe to the "Current Weather Data" API. You will receive an API key and you need to put it in the `src/constants.json` file.
In the `src/constants.json` file you will find the following code:

```
{
  "api_key": "<your_api_key>"
}
```

and you need to replace `<your_api_key>` with your API key.

### 4. Run the app:

```
yarn start
```

or

```
npm start
```

### 5. Open the app in the browser:

```
http://localhost:3000
```

### 6. Enjoy!
